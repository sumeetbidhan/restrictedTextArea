# Restricted Textarea

This project is a simple implementation of a textarea with live character count and a maximum character limit. As the user types, the character count dynamically updates. When the maximum character limit is reached, further input is restricted, and the textarea visually indicates this with a red border.

## Features
- **Live Character Count**: Displays the current character count as the user types.
- **Maximum Character Limit**: Restricts the user from typing more characters than the specified limit.
- **Visual Feedback**: Changes the border color to red when the limit is reached.

## Demo
Check out the full project implementation and learn more about it on [Restricted Textarea Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/projects/restricted-textarea).

## Repository
The source code for this project is available on GitHub:
[https://github.com/sumeetbidhan/restrictedTextArea](https://github.com/sumeetbidhan/restrictedTextArea)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
- A modern web browser to test the project.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumeetbidhan/restrictedTextArea.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd restrictedTextArea
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

## File Structure
```
restrictedTextArea/
├── index.html     # HTML structure
├── styles.css     # CSS for styling
├── script.js      # JavaScript for functionality
```

## How It Works
1. **HTML**: Provides the structure, including the textarea and a character count display.
2. **CSS**: Styles the textarea, including visual cues like the red border when the limit is reached.
3. **JavaScript**: Dynamically updates the character count and enforces the maximum character limit.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helps you practice:
- Handling user input events with JavaScript.
- Providing real-time feedback to users.
- Manipulating the DOM to create dynamic interactions.

## Future Enhancements
- Add an error message when the character limit is reached.
- Include animations for visual feedback.
- Create a submit button that gets disabled when the limit is exceeded.
